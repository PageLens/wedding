# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      dylan_paragraph1: "Dylan was born to a poor family in England. At the age of 20, he was granted an interest-free loan of Â£2500 by the Prince's Trust and started Gameplay, a business selling computer games. After five years, he had built Europe's largest direct selling computer games business."
      dylan_paragraph2: "When Dylan was 25, Gameplay was listed on the London Stock Exchange, the first .com business on the LSE, making him the youngest director of a public company in the UK at that time and the 9th of 30 (according to The Guardian newspaper). He bought himself a Ferrari, a Porsche, several BMWs and traveled to work by helicopter. But despite his high flying life, he wasn't happy."
      dylan_paragraph3: "Dylan decided to seek something more meaningful and so he traveled the world in search of adventure and purpose. It was a Filipino friend who finally led him to what he was searching for. After hearing about Gawad Kalinga, a slum redevelopment program, he flew to the Philippines in January 2003 for a closer look and was astonished by what he saw."
      dylan_paragraph4: "In April 2003, Dylan returned to the Philippines planning to stay for only 6 weeks, yet 10 years later, he is still there. He spent 5 years coordinating Gawad Kalinga's international partnership efforts, then in November 2008, he started Human Nature, a social enterprise, with his wife Anna and sister-in-law Camille Meloto."
      dylan_paragraph5: "Human Nature produces natural, Philippine-made personal care products and aims to provide livelihood for 100's of poor communities. As of September 2013, Human Nature had 26 branches in the Philippines, as well as distribution in the USA, Malaysia, Singapore and the UAE and had sold more than 10 million products in the last four years."
